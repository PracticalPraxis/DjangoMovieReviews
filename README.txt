A movie reviewing website I made in Django alongside the book Django 4.0 for the Impataient by Greg Lim and Daniel Correa.

I've populated the database with some example films I personally enjoy.

The web app performs showcases several different functions including:

Search
Account Management
Content Creation in the form of movie reviews
& much, much more! (Only marginally more honestly)


TO DO:

Create user movie upload functionality: currently only achievable with dev tools.
